General Adversarial Network for Colour Vision Deficiency


- Generating datasets and building a GAN for generating recoloured images for people with color vision deficiency
-   Firstly, we downloaded a flower dataset from oxford's official website, we simulated these images as perceived by red blind people and recolored these images using a Hassan and Paramesran recolouring algorithm using python and it's various libraries and google colaboratory. Then we used these datasets and fed them to the GAN we built. This in turn generated new recoloured images for a test dataset.
-   People with red color blindness can perceive the recoloured images better, the naturalness of the image is maintained in our algorithm
-   The project is done for a social cause, that is the special feature of the project
